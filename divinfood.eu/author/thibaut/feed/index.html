<p>DIVINFOOD’s Kick off Meeting (KoM) took place in March 2022, in the incredible city of Lyon.</p>



<p>The Executive Committee of the project (its Work-Package Leaders and Co-leaders) had to have an early start, on the evening of the 15<sup>th</sup> while the remaining project partners would join the morning after.</p>



<p>Both the 16<sup>th</sup> and the 17<sup>th</sup> of March were filled with presentations discussions and activities.</p>



<p>All Work-Package Leaders had an opportunity to present as well as the Living-Lab Coordinators. And all partners were able to join, comment and even debate on the workplan and the main tasks, milestones and deliverables for the project. A special presence was a member of DIVINFOOD Stakeholder Advisory Board – Teresa Borelli from <em>Alliance Bioversity-CIAT</em>, who engaged and support with ideas and absolutely crucial advice.</p>



<p>Despite meetings starting quite early in the morning (at 7:45 a.m. at the bus stop we were on the ball), there was also a bit of time for short site visits and have amazing food. Such a case was the fantastic meal in the evening of the 16<sup>th</sup> by Chef Tetedoi, and the surprising site visit to <em>Institut Paul Bocuse</em> on the afternoon of the 17<sup>th</sup>. This KoM, really provided a great start for the DIVINFOOD project, as partners choke their hands and waved goodbye, but with the re-assured commitment in the work ahead.</p>

<p>On the Summer of 2021, the 26 partners of the DIVINFOOD project were informed that indeed they had been winners of a Horizon 2020 grant.</p>



<p>Despite the project only effectively starting in the March 2022 almost, a year after, there was quite some preparation involved beforehand (updating each partner’s team, signing a grant agreement, planning a Kick-off meeting, etc..).</p>



<p>The project would be coordinated by Yuna Chiffoleau (INRAE, France) , its 8 work-package leaders to form the executive committee (from AgriKulti, INRAE, mP-mC, ITQB, OMKI, ICOEL, FiBL, CREA, Univ. Pise, FIRAB, Open Food Network (France), ACTIA, INRAE). The expectations are great and so is the energy. Good things to expect from DIVINFOOD ahead.</p>
